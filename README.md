#Dataset details: a. Custom Dataset(made by myself)

Explanation:- Loading Data: The load_data() function reads the dataset (real_estate_data.csv) and caches it using Streamlit's @st.cache decorator for better performance. Training the Model: The train_model() function splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Prediction: The predict_price() function takes user inputs (location, size_in_sqft, bedrooms, amenities) and uses the trained model to predict the property price.Streamlit. Interface: Displays a title for the app.Provides input fields (text_input, number_input, selectbox) for users to enter property details.Button triggers the price prediction and displays the result using st.success.

Running the Application:- Save the above code in a Python file (e.g.,realestate.py).Place your data.csv file in the same directory.Open a terminal or command prompt and run the Streamlit app: streamlit run realestate.py
